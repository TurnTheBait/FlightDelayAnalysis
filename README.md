# Flight Delay Analysis and Prediction Using Weather Data

This repository contains the software project developed for the Master’s Thesis in Computer Engineering.

The goal of the project is to build a system capable of collecting, analyzing, and cross-referencing flight status data with weather data.
The final objective is to study the correlation between weather conditions and flight delays, ultimately creating a predictive model.
