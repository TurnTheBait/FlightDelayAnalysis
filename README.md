# AI enabled web-based sentiment analysis of airports negative externalities

The project aims to develop a system for monitoring and analyzing airport negative externalities, with a specific focus on passenger perception of **flight delays** and **noise pollution**. Utilizing AI-driven sentiment analysis on multi-source, multi-language data, the system quantifies public perception and cross-references it with operational flight data to provide actionable insights into airport performance and environmental impact.
